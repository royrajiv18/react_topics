/*
Lazy loading in React allows you to split your code into smaller chunks, loading only the code that is 
needed for a particular part of your application when it is actually required.

- lazy() is used to dynamically import components only when theyâ€™re needed.
- Suspense is a component provided by React that lets you "wait" for the dynamic import to load,
  showing a fallback UI in the meantime
